# C Programming
C programs implemented as a part of __Introduction to C__ course at __VIT University__.
Programs cover various topics such as Loops, Arrays, Functions, String Handling, Pointers, Files.

Please go thorugh the Cycle sheet files to get the list of programs.

### Sample Programs

#### FUNCTIONS 
* Write an user-defined function named SHIFT to circularly shift the given array elements towards the right. Call this function in the main( ) to perform the shifting for specified number of times.

#### STRING HANDLING
* Write a menu driven program to perform the following string operations with and without using built-in functions.
  <br>i)	String length
  <br>ii)	String Copy
  <br>iii) String Concatenation
  <br>iv) String Compare
  <br>v) Substring extraction

#### STRUCTURES
* A hospital keeps a list of blood donors in which each record has the following fields:
<br> "NAME,AGE,ADDRESS and BLOOD TYPE"
<br> Write a program to create an array of structures to store all these details and print the list of all blood donors whose age is below 35 and blood type is ‘O+’.

#### POINTERS 
* Using Pointers, write a program to perform matrix addition.

#### FILES
* A random access file contains records of all employees of a company. The management announces 15% hike in DA only for the Project Leaders. Update the relevant records in the same file and display its contents. Also, display the nth record of the file.
